# woocommerce-extra-consent
Extra Consent is an plugin that allows you to display an additional consent request on the Checkout page (for example for Viber membership, WhatsApp group or similar).  
In Settings you can: set the text of the consent you are looking for; to determine whether the request will be mandatory or not (initially it is set to NOT be mandatory, but if you decide that it is mandatory then it will not be possible to proceed to payment until consent is given); to set an error message that will appear if the user has not given consent (appears only if the request is mandatory).  
If the buyer agrees, then his data is automatically filled in the Uncontacted table. And when a buyer is contacted (or added to a group or otherwise processed) then just click on the checkbox next to his data and he will automatically move to the Contacted table.  
Both tables also show the agreement that they entered into, so that if the text of the agreement you are looking are changed, you can know what the buyer agreed to.  
If the user's email is already registered in the plugin database, then this additional field will no longer be displayed.
